## Types of Financial Diversification

### 1. By Asset Class
- Mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and cash.  
- Balances growth potential (stocks) with stability (bonds).  

### 2. By Industry / Sector
- Investing in multiple sectors such as technology, healthcare, energy, and consumer goods.  
- Protects against sector-specific downturns.  

### 3. By Geography
- Domestic vs. international markets.  
- Reduces exposure to risks in a single country (political, economic, currency risks).  

### 4. By Investment Style
- Growth stocks, value stocks, dividend-paying stocks.  
- Different styles perform better in different market conditions.  

### 5. By Time Horizon
- Combining short-term liquid assets with long-term investments.  
- Provides both stability and future growth.  

## Advantages

- Lowers overall portfolio risk.  
- Helps maintain more stable returns.

## Disadvantages

- Over-diversification may limit profits.  
- Management becomes more complex.

## Key Points / Notes

- Diversification lowers unsystematic risk (company or sector-specific) but cannot eliminate market-wide (systematic) risk.  
- Optimal diversification depends on investor goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.  
- Rebalancing is necessary to maintain intended allocation as markets change.
