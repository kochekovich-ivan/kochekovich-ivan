## Purpose
- CAPM explains the relationship between **expected return** and **risk** of an asset.
- Helps investors estimate what return they should demand for taking on a given level of risk.

## Formula
Expected Return (E[R]) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)

## Components
- Risk-Free Rate — return on a risk-free investment (e.g., government bonds).
- Market Return — average expected return of the overall market.
- Market Risk Premium — (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate), extra return for taking market risk.
- Beta — measures asset's sensitivity to market movements:
  - Beta = 1 → moves with the market
  - Beta > 1 → more volatile than the market
  - Beta < 1 → less volatile than the market
  - Beta < 0 → moves opposite to the market

## Interpretation
- CAPM gives the **theoretical fair return** for a given level of risk.
- If asset's actual expected return > CAPM return → asset is undervalued (good buy).
- If asset's actual expected return < CAPM return → asset is overvalued (avoid).

## Why It Matters
- Widely used in portfolio management and cost of equity calculations.
- Helps balance risk and return when choosing investments.
- Basis for understanding systematic (market) risk vs unsystematic (diversifiable) risk.
