## 1. Return

**Definition:** The gain or loss from an investment over a period of time, usually expressed as a percentage of the initial investment.

**Types:**
- **Expected return** – the average return anticipated based on probabilities of outcomes.
- **Realized return** – the actual return earned.
- **Nominal vs. real return** – nominal is unadjusted; real accounts for inflation.

**Sources of return:**
- **Income** (dividends, interest payments, rental income)
- **Capital gains** (price appreciation of the asset)

**Example:** Earning 5% interest from a bond and 10% price increase from a stock.

## 2. Risk

**Definition:** The possibility that actual returns will differ from expected returns; uncertainty in outcomes.

**Types of risk:**
- **Systematic risk (market risk):** cannot be diversified away; caused by economy-wide factors (e.g., recessions, interest rate changes).
- **Unsystematic risk (specific risk):** linked to a company or sector; can be reduced through diversification.

**Measures of risk:**
- **Volatility (standard deviation):** shows variability of returns.
- **Beta:** measures asset sensitivity to market movements.
- **Value at Risk (VaR):** estimates potential loss under adverse conditions.

**Example:** A tech stock with high volatility vs. a government bond with low volatility.

## 3. Risk–Return Tradeoff

**Definition:** The principle that higher potential returns come with higher levels of risk. Investors must balance their risk tolerance with desired returns.

- **High risk, high return:** Stocks, cryptocurrencies, startups  
- **Medium risk, medium return:** Corporate bonds, diversified ETFs  
- **Low risk, low return:** Government bonds, savings accounts  

**Example:** Choosing between investing $1,000 in Tesla stock (high risk/return) or a U.S. Treasury bond (low risk/return).

## 4. Diversification

**Definition:** Strategy of spreading investments across different assets to reduce unsystematic risk.

**Ways to diversify:**
- By asset class (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities)
- By geography (domestic vs. international markets)
- By sector (technology, healthcare, energy)

**Benefit:** Lowers overall portfolio risk without necessarily reducing returns.

**Example:** A portfolio of U.S. stocks, European bonds, and gold ETF.
