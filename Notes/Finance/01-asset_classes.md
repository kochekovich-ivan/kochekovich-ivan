\# Finance: Asset Classes (Stocks, Bonds, ETFs)

\## 1. Stocks

Income:



Capital gains (price increases).



Dividends (periodic payments to shareholders, if company distributes profit).



Risk: High. Prices fluctuate strongly depending on market, company performance, and global events.



Return: Potentially high (historically, stocks outperform bonds over long horizons).



Example: Buying Tesla shares (TSLA) on NASDAQ.



\## 2. Bonds



Definition: A loan you give to a government or a corporation. You are the creditor, they are the debtor.



Income:



Coupon payments (fixed interest, e.g., 3% annually).



Principal repayment (at maturity).
