# Finance: Asset Classes (Stocks, Bonds, ETFs)

---

## 1. Stocks

Definition: A share of ownership in a company. Owning a stock means owning a fraction of that business.

Income:
- Capital gains (price increases)
- Dividends (periodic payments if company distributes profit)

Risk: High â€“ prices fluctuate depending on market, company performance, and global events  
Return: Potentially high; historically, stocks outperform bonds over long horizons  

Example: Buying Tesla shares (TSLA) on NASDAQ

## 2. Bonds

Definition: A loan you give to a government or corporation. You are the creditor; they are the debtor.

Income:
- Coupon payments (fixed interest, e.g., 3% annually)
- Principal repayment at maturity

Risk: Low, especially for government bonds; corporate bonds may have default risk  
Return: Lower than stocks, but more stable  

Example: Buying a 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond

## 3. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

Definition: A basket of securities (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.) that trades like a stock

Types:
- Stock ETFs (e.g., S&P 500 index fund)
- Bond ETFs
- Sector ETFs (e.g., technology, energy)
- Commodity ETFs (e.g., gold)

Risk: Medium, depends on ETF composition, usually lower than single stock  
Return: Balanced, allows diversification  

Example: Buying SPY (ETF tracking S&P 500)
