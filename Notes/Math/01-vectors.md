\# Vectors



\## Perspectives



Physics: arrows in space, defined by length and direction.



CS: ordered lists of numbers (e.g., features of an object).



Math: abstract objects with rules:



&nbsp;	Addition of vectors



&nbsp;	Multiplication by scalars



\## Coordinates



2D: 

\[x,y] – move along x-axis, then y-axis.



3D: 

\[x,y,z] – move along x, then y, then z.



\## Operations



Addition: component-wise.



&nbsp;	\[x1​,y1​]+\[x2​,y2​]=\[x1​+x2​,y1​+y2​]



Scalar multiplication: stretch/squish/flip.

&nbsp;	a⋅\[x,y]=\[ax,ay]





\## Notes



Scalars = numbers that scale vectors.



Convention: vectors start at the origin.



Every vector corresponds to a unique coordinate list.
