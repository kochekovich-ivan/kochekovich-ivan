## 1. Linear Combination
**Definition:** A vector built from scaling and adding other vectors.  
**Formula:** a₁·v₁ + a₂·v₂ + ... + aₙ·vₙ  
**Example:** (x, y) = x·(1,0) + y·(0,1)

## 2. Span
**Definition:** The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors.  
**Example:** Span{(1,0), (0,1)} = entire 2D plane (ℝ²).

---

## 3. Basis
**Definition:** A minimal set of linearly independent vectors that span the space.  
**Example:** {(1,0), (0,1)} is the standard basis for ℝ².

## 4. Key Idea
- **Linear combinations** → building blocks  
- **Span** → the “territory” they cover  
- **Basis** → smallest independent set that fully describes the space
