## 1. Linear Transformation
**Definition:** A function that maps vectors to vectors, preserving addition and scalar multiplication.

**Properties:**
- T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
- T(c * v) = c * T(v)

**Example:** Scaling, rotation, or reflection of vectors.

## 2. Matrix Representation
**Definition:** A matrix is a way to represent a linear transformation compactly.

**Example:** A 2x2 matrix transforms 2D vectors.

---

## 3. Applying Transformations
**How to apply:** Multiply the transformation matrix by a vector to get the transformed vector.

**Example:**  
If A = [[1, 0], [0, 2]] and v = [x, y], then A*v = [x, 2*y]
