# Vectors

## Perspectives

- **Physics**: arrows in space, defined by **length** and **direction**.
- **Computer Science**: ordered lists of numbers (e.g., features of an object).
- **Mathematics**: abstract objects with rules for:
  - Vector addition
  - Multiplication by scalars

## Coordinates

- **2D**: `[x, y]` – move along x-axis, then y-axis.
- **3D**: `[x, y, z]` – move along x-axis, then y-axis, then z-axis.

## Operations

- **Addition**: component-wise.  
  `[x1, y1] + [x2, y2] = [x1+x2, y1+y2]`

- **Scalar multiplication**: stretch, shrink, or flip.  
  `a * [x, y] = [a*x, a*y]`

## Notes

- **Scalars** are numbers that scale vectors.
- Convention: vectors start at the origin.
- Every vector corresponds to a unique coordinate list.
