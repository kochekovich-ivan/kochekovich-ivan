# Linear Algebra: Matrix Basics

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Example of a 2×3 (2 rows, 3 columns) matrix:

Each entry is referred to by its row and column index.

### Matrix Addition

You can add two matrices only if they have the same shape.
The result is obtained by adding corresponding elements.

### Scalar Multiplication

Multiplying a matrix by a scalar means multiplying every element by that number.

### Matrix Multiplication

Defined if the **number of columns** of the first matrix equals the **number of rows** of the second.
Multiply rows of the first by columns of the second (dot product).

### Special Matrices

**Zero matrix**: all entries are zero.
**Identity matrix**​: square matrix with 1’s on the main diagonal, 0’s elsewhere.
