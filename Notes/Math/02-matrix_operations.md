## Vectors

### Perspectives on Vectors

1. **Physics Perspective**: Vectors are arrows in space. Defined by **length** and **direction**. Moving the vector without changing these properties keeps it the same.
2. **Computer Science Perspective**: Vectors are **ordered lists of numbers**. Example: a house represented as `[square footage, price]`.
3. **Mathematics Perspective**: Vectors are objects where **vector addition** and **scalar multiplication** are defined. Vectors start from the origin.

### Vector Coordinates

- 2D vector `[x, y]`: x = movement along x-axis, y = movement along y-axis.
- 3D vector `[x, y, z]`: z = movement along the z-axis, perpendicular to x and y.

### Vector Operations

1. **Addition**: Tip-to-tail method or coordinate-wise addition.  
   Example: `[1, 2] + [3, -1] = [4, 1]`
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply each component by a number.  
   - Positive number: stretch
   - Fraction: shrink
   - Negative: reverse direction and scale

## Matrices

### Definition

A matrix is a **rectangular array of numbers** arranged in rows and columns.

Example of a 2x3 matrix:

[ a11 a12 a13 ]
[ a21 a22 a23 ]


### Matrix Addition

- Only possible if matrices have the **same shape**.
- Add corresponding elements.

[1 2] [5 6] [6 8]
[3 4] + [7 8] = [10 12]


### Scalar Multiplication

- Multiply every element by a scalar.

2 * [1 2] = [2 4]
[3 4] [6 8]


### Matrix Multiplication

- Number of **columns of first matrix** = number of **rows of second matrix**.
- Multiply rows by columns (dot product).

[1 2] [5 6 7] [15+28 16+29 17+210]
[3 4] * [8 9 10] = [35+48 36+49 37+410]


### Special Matrices

- **Zero matrix**: all entries are 0
- **Identity matrix**: square matrix with 1's on the diagonal, 0's elsewhere

[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]


### Transpose

- Flips a matrix over its diagonal (rows become columns)

[1 2 3]áµ€ = [1 0]
[0 4 5] [2 4]
[3 5]
