## Explanation

A **power** (or exponent) represents repeated multiplication of a number by itself.  
If a number `b` is multiplied by itself `n` times, it is written as:

b^n = b × b × … × b (n times)  

Where:  
- `b` is the **base**  
- `n` is the **exponent** or **power**  

### Special Cases
- b^0 = 1 (for b ≠ 0)  
- b^1 = b  
- b^(-n) = 1 / (b^n)  

## Properties

1. **Product of Powers:**  
   b^m × b^n = b^(m+n)

2. **Quotient of Powers:**  
   b^m / b^n = b^(m−n)  

3. **Power of a Power:**  
   (b^m)^n = b^(m×n)

4. **Power of a Product:**  
   (ab)^n = a^n × b^n

5. **Power of a Quotient:**  
   (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n  

6. **Negative Exponent:**  
   b^(-n) = 1 / b^n  

7. **Fractional Exponent:**  
   b^(1/n) = n-th root of b  
   b^(m/n) = (n-th root of b)^m

## Examples

- 2^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8  
- 5^0 = 1  
- 2^(-3) = 1 / (2^3) = 1/8  
- (2 × 3)^2 = 2^2 × 3^2 = 36  
- 8^(2/3) = (cube root of 8)^2 = 2^2 = 4  

## Applications / Use Cases

- Calculations involving growth/decay (population, interest, physics).  
- Scientific notation for very large or small numbers.  
- Algorithm complexity in computer science (exponential growth).  
- Compound interest and finance formulas.  
- Electrical engineering (power and voltage formulas).

## Key Points / Notes

- Understand difference between base and exponent.  
- Negative and fractional exponents represent reciprocal and roots.  
- Many logarithm formulas rely on exponent properties.
